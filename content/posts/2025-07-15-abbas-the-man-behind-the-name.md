# 👨‍💻 Ctrl-Shift-Abbas | `@4bbvs`

> *Tech. Music. Philosophy.*  
> Exploring code, sound, and the chaos in between.

Hey, I'm Abbas — a high schooler building weirdly cool things at the intersection of logic and creativity. I make software, write music, shoot edits, and think in systems. I’m also 16. This profile is my playground.
