## Why the Hiatus?
I have not updated this blog I made for a while and the reason for that was boards.
I am a CBSE student in India and for the uninitiated, the 10th grade boards are hyped a lot.

I recently had a moment of clarity where I realised that all of the projects I have worked on, are being lost to time as well as the different certificates, and experiences among other things. The idea is that this website is the perfect way to catalogue all of that information. (Mainly to help me get into a good university)

## Recent Developments
- My friends and business partners recently bought a penthouse and now I have access to a dedicated office space, which allows me to edit for my clients in a much more formal manner.

- last week, I worked on a small ATV, (modular so that we can add functionality as we see fit)

- also worked on fixing this drone (that some students failed to get working) (had to do basically all from scratch)

- Made a spotify plugin I have been wanting for a while (using spicetify) (available on my github)
I got some traction on it!

- I emailed a professor to ask for AI research opportunities (I spoke to him at a summer school event, He was charmed by my knowledge, seems to be a great mentor, now lets see if I get an email back!)




(have decided on not adding previous projects/competitions and looking forward, as doing all of that is somewhat redundant as I will do greater things, and to be honest with you it seems like a monumental task to dig up all the skeletons)

in the future, I have a lot of projects lined up, the more ambitious of which is an experimental Airplane. Having delved deep into the topic, the first hurdle is to get the engine. I emailed Honda India, to ask for a L15B 1.5 Petrol I-vtec engine (fingers crossed)
